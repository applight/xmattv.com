If you have a bidirectional graph representing the brain and you reduce it to a connection matrix where each row has a unique (sortable ordered) value, (+) the amount of potential emparted on that connection, in a sinlge step, to fire to the next neuron, (- virtual) the potential emparted in step with all connected (-) neurons in that path


If you reduce to an adjacency matrix with zero, one (or two from a virtually connected neuron only -potential leading to it). You then have a O(xy^1) growth (the exponent on branching becomes one or two, but the virtual path is calculated in step and always ends on a positive connection -- they are generated to demonstrate resistance and preserve strict ordering, which I hope we can say the brain will support a different nnumber of electrons -minimum per connection- to provoke the exchange  -- the minimum 1 or -1 is the least common factor of the n intege multiple of electorns required for the least 'electron wanting' connetion in that brain)

Either way we can make tractable, but huge n super computers, that can now do brain dynamics in PTIME.

I suspect you would see n^25000 worst case scenerio neurons for an 25k average connected neuron brain... an^0 + bn^15000 / c for a decent guess, a, b, and c: weight weight and magic respectively: for a decent guess as to number of neurons

So you would then wish to have roughtly that log_(that number)(aveQ) = number of tape symbols

q! = number of tape symbols | q is the number of neurons inthe tape
where q will ALWAYS be able to accomodate a SAT solver by growing in pave neuron for symbol with room to CACHE-PATH-TRAVERSAL-RESULTS-OR-PATH WITH ROOM q! > b^q for any q where q is the nnumber of sat solver logic vars whatever tired

EITHER WAY

PARTITION A BRAIN INTO NON OPTIMSL DTM ENCODINGS AND USE THE TAPE SYBOL
